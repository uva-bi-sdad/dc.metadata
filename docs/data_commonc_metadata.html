Generally, blocks are small in area; for example, a city block bounded on all sides by streets. Blocks in suburban and rural areas may be larger, more irregular in shape, and bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and transmission lines. In remote areas, blocks may even encompass hundreds of square miles. Blocks cover the entire territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. Blocks nest within all other tabulated census geographic entities at the time of the decennial census and are the basis for all tabulated data from that census. Census Block Numbers—Blocks are numbered uniquely with a four-digit census block number from 0000 to 9999 within census tract, which nest within state and county. The first digit of the census block number identifies the block group. Block numbers beginning with a zero (in Block Group 0) are intended to include only water area, but not all water-only blocks have block numbers beginning with 0 (zero).","Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to present data and control block numbering. A block group consists of clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . . , 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau’s Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate in PSAP, and a regional organization or the State Data Center was not available to participate. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within the census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross state, county, or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity. Tribal census tracts and tribal BGs are separate and unique geographic areas defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and can cross state and county boundaries (see “Tribal Census Tract” and “Tribal Block Group”). The tribal census tracts and tribal block groups may be completely different from the standard county-based census tracts and block groups defined for the same area.","Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or statistically equivalent entity that can be updated by local participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau’s Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant responded or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.\r\n\r\nCensus tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of substantial population decline.\r\n\r\nCensus tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features. They may follow nonvisible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses. State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy. Tribal census tracts are a unique geographic entity defined within federally recognized American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands and can cross state and county boundaries. The tribal census tracts may be completely different from the standard county-based census tracts defined for the same area. (see “Tribal Census Tract”).","The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes. In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, municipalities, and census areas; the latter of which are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau. Additionally, the Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: municipios in Puerto Rico, districts and islands in American Samoa, municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and, thus, constitute primary divisions of their states. These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation. The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation in decennial censuses. All of the counties in Connecticut and Rhode Island and nine counties in Massachusetts were dissolved as functioning governmental entities; however, the Census Bureau continues to present data for these historical entities in order to provide comparable geographic units at the county level of the geographic hierarchy for these states and represents them as nonfunctioning legal entities in data products. Each county or statistically equivalent entity is assigned a three-character numeric Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code based on alphabetical sequence that is unique within state, and an eight-digit National Standard (NS) code.","Organizing unit for the Virginia Department of Health",null,null,"School Districts are geographic entities and single purpose governmental units that operate schools and provide public educational services at the local level. "],["https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html","https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html","https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html","https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/about/glossary.html","https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/local-health-districts/",null,null,"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>abbreviation<\/th>\n      <th>name<\/th>\n      <th>defined by<\/th>\n      <th>description<\/th>\n      <th>link<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
