# Check dataset metadata

# This will be information for tables, not individual measures
# Or both?

# First check: On selected measures
# Unique measure : table_name, does it exist in current metadata? Yes or no
# If yes, print out information to check if its right

# We can match on expected geographies and geographic units (this is actually in metadata, doesn't need to be provided by user)
# Match on sources -> create sources
# Match on citations -> create citations
